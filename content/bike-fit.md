## Why You Should Do a Bike Fit

Cycling is awesome, but it can be tough on your body.
Small positioning issues might not seem like a big deal at first, but they will definitely bite you on longer rides.
For example, pain in your ankles, knees, hips, lower back, shoulders, and wrists—especially once you hit those 4+ hour rides.

Dialing in your bike fit will help you:

- Avoid those nagging aches and pains
- Stay comfortable on longer rides
- Keep riding without breaking down over time
- And most importantly, have more fun for longer!

You don't need to be a pro to benefit from optimizing your position.
It's worth taking the time to get it right.

## Why You Should Do It Yourself

Bike fitting can get pretty technical and is highly individual—people love to debate every little detail.
But unless you're a pro racer who is chasing marginal gains, most of us just want to be comfortable on the bike.

Doing your own fit has some real benefits:

- You'll save money on fitting fees
- You'll learn how your body works on the bike
- You can tweak things as you go

Of course, if you're still uncomfortable or dealing with pain after trying this, definitely see a professional fitter or your doctor.
And hey, if you'd rather pay someone else to handle it because you don't have time or just can't be bothered, go for it!
But if you're the DIY type who likes learning new stuff and saving some cash, this guide is for you.

To itereate: this guide is a way to get comfortable and efficient on your bike without overthinking it.
This guide will not turn you into a wind-cheating speed demon.

If you only care about performance, you may want to watch this [documentary about Graeme Obree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKta3RPyLIo) to get some ideas :wink:

## How to Read This Guide

Everything on your bike is connected and even small changes can make a big difference.
That's why it's important to fight the urge to change everything at once.

If you've never fitted your bike before, it's actually okay to make bigger changes to get a baseline.
From there, you can make small tweaks over time to dial it in.
We'll work from the bottom up because the higher we go, the more room there is for customization.

**If you're new to this:** Start at the top of the guide and follow every step.
After a few rides, come back and make small tweaks.

**If you're already cycling:** Either start from the beginning changing one thing at a time, or jump to specific sections that interest you.

> [!TIP]
> Bike fitting is highly individual.
> The ranges and numbers here are based on averages and research, your comfort might fall within or even slightly outside these ranges.
> The best approach is to rely on your bodies proprioception (the body's sense of its own position, movement, and balance aka. when something "feels right").
>
> This can be tough when you're starting out. So we'll use some common measurements as a starting point.
> As you develop a better sense of your body on the bike, you can adjust from there.
> Ride with new settings for a couple weeks before deciding if they work.
>
> Also, your flexibility and fitness changes over time too.
> So as you ride more, your current position might start to feel uncomfortable.
> Or you might be able to achive a more performant position.
> In such case, adjust and test in small increments.
>
<!-- > Finally, don't get caught up in every trend or what the pros are doing.
> They're stronger, more flexible, and chasing every tiny performance gain they can get.
> That probably doesn't matter for your weekend rides. -->

## The Frame

## Shoes

Your shoes and cleats – sometimes called shoe-pedal interface – create one of three connection points to your bike.
They transfer power from your legs to move you forward, so getting the fit right matters for both performance and comfort.
Since your foot position affects all other bike adjustments, shoes need to fit well without causing numbness.
While insoles can help with power transfer and comfort, we won't cover them in this guide.

> [!TIP]
> Even though, stiff cycling shoes with cleats may improve performance on high intenisity activities like sprints[^1] there seems to be no evidence that stiff cycling shoes increase performance or efficency[^2].
> So if you're new to cycling, regular shoes work fine while you figure out if cycling is for you.
> Anecdotely, I believe stiff cycling shoes help to save energy since your feet won't slip around and may reduce fatigue on long rides, but this has to be studied in the future.
>
> If you decide to get cycling shoes, don't stress too much about shoe stiffness.
> While some stiffness is helpful, using stiffer shoes doesn't always improve performance.
> There appears to be a point where adding more stiffness stops providing benefits[^3].

### Shoe Length And Width

Shoe sizing is tricky.
Your feet swell during long rides, so don't go too tight.
Also, cycling shoes usually run small, so you'll likely need a size or two bigger than normal (I wear EU43 in regular shoes but need EU45 for cycling).
Furthermore, sizes vary wildly between brands, and converting between EU/US/UK sizes is a mess.
I recommend ignore shoe sizes and measure your actual feet in millimeters instead.

**Measuring your feet:**

1. Put a piece of paper/cardboard against a wall
2. Step on it with your heel against the wall
3. Mark where your longest toe ends
4. Measure the length in millimeters
5. Do the same for width at the widest part of your foot

**Checking the fit:**
Take out the shoe's insole and measure its length and width.
Compare to your foot measurements.
If your foot is more than 5mm longer or wider than the insole, go up a size.
Your longest toe should never touch the front of the shoe.

### Cleat Position And Foot Alignment

clip-in pedals

fifth metatarsophalangeal joints (the big toe joint and the little toe joint)

https://www.sq-lab.com/en/us/ergonomics/numb-feet-and-toes-while-cycling

 A simple way to find this: feel the bony bump at the base of your big toe

 A cleat too far back (toward the heel) is less common in road cycling (aside from some long-distance riders who prefer mid-foot cleat positions), but extreme backward placement can feel awkward and potentially cause arch pain or calf underutilization

 As a rule of thumb, if in doubt, err on the side of moving cleats slightly back rather than forward

In many cases, changes that improve comfort and reduce injury risk also allow a cyclist to perform better in the long run, because they can train and race without pain holding them back.

Foot pacemnten is an important factotor in zour performacne and injury preventions but ist not the biggest screw for
performance factors. Sure, if you have a negative impact on your perfromance but after a reasobanle fitting of your cleats there is nott much performance to gain and more about injury prevention and being comfortable.

> [!NOTE]
> And for the cleat mechanism: doesn matter as well, use what ever works for you. For exampe if you already drive a mnt bike with cleats there is no reason to buy another mechanism.

There are three variables in cleat positoin:

- fore-aft placement or set back
- roation (toesin or toe-out) and float (freedom to rotate)
- lateratl position (side-to-side on the shoe or stance width)

This guide will focus set back so if the cleat is t set more toe or more aft, as the other are way more complex and the evidence not that good.

to find the correct position for your cleat, get in your shoes and find the 5th head bonde part of your small toe. if you found it put some tape over it and mark roughtly the middle. Do this for both sides

take off your shoes and put them on the flat surface and from the dot draw a straight line to the bottom.

Now adjust your celats so your axel is righ on the höge od our marking. some cleats have a little marker where the axel will be here is a example of the shimano cleants, where oyu can see a little notch.

The traditional approach ist to put the axel right under your 5th head. first metatarsal headright under the axel. under the ball

Modern stiff cycling shoes allow more freedom to adjust cleat position without power loss, and some bike fitters now suggest a slightly more rearward cleat placement (toward the midfoot) than the classic position

 For example, placing the cleat midpoint between the first and fifth metatarsal heads (a bit behind the ball of the foot) can increase foot stability by shortening the foot’s lever arm and may reduce stress on the Achilles tendon

A 2023 study by Chartogne et al. had competitive cyclists perform trials with cleats at three positions (standard ball-of-foot, 15 mm forward, 15 mm back) and found no significant differences in power output, cadence, oxygen consumption, or sprint performance among the positions

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35129429/#:~:text=The%20aim%20of%20this%20study,differences%20were%20found%20regarding%20joint
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35129429/#:~:text=kinematics%3A%20hip%2C%20knee%2C%20and%20ankle,cleat%20position
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39285616/#:~:text=saddle%20height%2C%20trunk%20angle%20and,Q%20factor%20or%20cleat%20position

While power may not change, cleat position does influence biomechanics and load distribution among muscle groups.
By relieving the calves and Achilles tendon of some load, a rearward cleat can help riders who experience calf fatigue, Achilles tendon pain, or forefoot pressure (“hot foot”)

However, shifting the work up the leg means other muscles (quads, glutes) take on more load, which could affect fatigue distribution or knee stress.

an good and acceptes sarting point is the 5th after that it smmes situational and preference based for exampe pain in achilles or better in wuad shit aft.

just use common sense and do not go into the extremes: too forward may overwork the calves/Achilles, and too rearward may overload the knees or quads

This highlights that riders should treat cleat adjustments primarily as a means to improve biomechanics (comfort, joint loading) rather than as a direct performance tweak.

It appears that once a shoe is sufficiently stiff to support the foot, making it even stiffer yields diminishing returns. There is likely a threshold of stiffness beyond which human physiology can’t capitalize further

scientific literature regarding roation and lateral is limitted and erkennnise are more anecdotal. For rotaiton, you propböay
always want ateals a little bit float 1-3° or if you are a beginner a little bit more like  6°
and for the stance just to not go to the extremes and use your hip width as a rough guide line.

 your feet point in their natural, neutral orientation

 As a starting point, center the cleats left-right on the shoe. If you know you have hips or knees that feel better with a slightly wider or narrower stance, you can adjust (moving cleats inward on the shoe will position feet wider apart, and vice versa)

 Symptom Check – Foot and Knee Clues: As you dial in cleat position, pay attention to what your feet and knees tell you:

    Numb or tingling toes during rides often indicate cleats too far forward (or shoes too tight). Solution: move cleats slightly backward to reduce pressure on the toes, and/or loosen shoe straps a notch
    sq-lab.com
    .

    Pain on the inside or outside of your knees can indicate your feet are angling wrong (cleat rotation) – e.g., outer knee pain might mean you need to allow more toe-out. A slight cleat angle tweak can realign your knee tracking and alleviate that pain.

    Knee pain directly in front (around the kneecap) or just below it (patellar tendon) can be due to saddle height or fore-aft issues which we will address next, but keep cleat position in mind: if one knee feels strained, verify both cleats are positioned the same and allowing your preferred foot angle.
