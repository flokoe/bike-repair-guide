## Why You Should Do a Bike Fit

Cycling is awesome, but it can be tough on your body.
Small positioning issues might not seem like a big deal at first, but they will definitely bite you on longer rides.
For example, pain in your ankles, knees, hips, lower back, shoulders, and wrists—especially once you hit those 4+ hour rides.

Dialing in your bike fit will help you:

- Avoid those nagging aches and pains
- Stay comfortable on longer rides
- Keep riding without breaking down over time
- And most importantly, have more fun for longer!

You don't need to be a pro to benefit from optimizing your position.
It's worth taking the time to get it right.

## Why You Should Do It Yourself

Bike fitting can get pretty technical and is highly individual—people love to debate every little detail.
But unless you're a pro racer who is chasing marginal gains, most of us just want to be comfortable on the bike.

Doing your own fit has some real benefits:

- You'll save money on fitting fees
- You'll learn how your body works on the bike
- You can tweak things as you go

Of course, if you're still uncomfortable or dealing with pain after trying this, definitely see a professional fitter or your doctor.
And hey, if you'd rather pay someone else to handle it because you don't have time or just can't be bothered, go for it!
But if you're the DIY type who likes learning new stuff and saving some cash, this guide is for you.

To itereate: this guide is a way to get comfortable and efficient on your bike without overthinking it.
This guide will not turn you into a wind-cheating speed demon.

If you only care about performance, you may want to watch this [documentary about Graeme Obree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKta3RPyLIo) to get some ideas :wink:

## How to Read This Guide

Everything on your bike is connected and even small changes can make a big difference.
That's why it's important to fight the urge to change everything at once.

If you've never fitted your bike before, it's actually okay to make bigger changes to get a baseline.
From there, you can make small tweaks over time to dial it in.
We'll work from the bottom up because the higher we go, the more room there is for customization.

**If you're new to this:** Start at the top of the guide and follow every step.
After a few rides, come back and make small tweaks.

**If you're already cycling:** Either start from the beginning changing one thing at a time, or jump to specific sections that interest you.

> [!TIP]
> Bike fitting is highly individual.
> The ranges and numbers here are based on averages and research, your comfort might fall within or even slightly outside these ranges.
> The best approach is to rely on your bodies proprioception (the body's sense of its own position, movement, and balance aka. when something "feels right").
>
> This can be tough when you're starting out. So we'll use some common measurements as a starting point.
> As you develop a better sense of your body on the bike, you can adjust from there.
> Ride with new settings for a couple weeks before deciding if they work.
>
> Also, your flexibility and fitness changes over time too.
> So as you ride more, your current position might start to feel uncomfortable.
> Or you might be able to achive a more performant position.
> In such case, adjust and test in small increments.
>
<!-- > Finally, don't get caught up in every trend or what the pros are doing.
> They're stronger, more flexible, and chasing every tiny performance gain they can get.
> That probably doesn't matter for your weekend rides. -->

## Shoes

Your shoes and cleats – sometimes called shoe-pedal interface – create one of three connection points to your bike.
They transfer power from your legs into the pedals to move you forward, so getting the fit right matters for both performance and comfort.
Since your foot position affects all other bike adjustments, shoes need to fit well without causing numbness.
While insoles can help with power transfer and comfort, we won't cover them in this guide.

> [!TIP]
> Even though, stiff cycling shoes with cleats may improve performance on high intenisity activities like sprints.[^1] There seems to be no evidence that stiff cycling shoes increase performance or efficency.[^2]
> So if you're new to cycling, regular shoes work fine while you figure out if cycling is for you.
> Anecdotely, I believe stiff cycling shoes help to save energy since your feet won't slip around which may reduce fatigue on long rides, but this has to be studied in the future.
>
> If you decide to get cycling shoes, don't stress too much about shoe stiffness.
> While some stiffness is helpful, using stiffer shoes doesn't always improve performance.
> There appears to be a point where adding more stiffness stops providing benefits.[^3]

### Shoe Length And Width

Shoe sizing is tricky.
Your feet swell during long rides, so don't go too tight.
Also, cycling shoes usually run small, so you'll likely need a size or two bigger than normal (I wear EU43 in regular shoes but need EU45 for cycling).
Furthermore, sizes vary wildly between brands, and converting between EU/US/UK sizes is a mess.
I recommend to ignore shoe sizes and measure your actual feet in millimeters instead.

**Measuring your feet:**

1. Put a piece of paper/cardboard against a wall
2. Step on it with your heel against the wall
3. Mark where your longest toe ends
4. Measure the length in millimeters
5. Do the same for width at the widest part of your foot

**Checking the fit:**
Take out the shoe's insole and measure its length and width.
Compare to your foot measurements.
If your foot is more than 5mm longer/wider than the insole, go up a size.
Your longest toe should never touch the front of the shoe.
