About {{% years-since-start %}} ago, a good friend of mine finally convinced me to try a road bike.
Until that point, I had never sat on a road bike, nor was I particularly interested in cycling.

For me, cycling was just a mode of transport to get from A to B.
But at the same time, I was looking for a new sporting activity.
So I finally got over myself and bought a used road bike.

And boy was my first ride a revelation!
Even though I was a little wobbly on the bike, it was a lot of fun.
The feeling if you fly over the tarmac down in the drops is exhilarating.
But the best part was that after I came back from my ride, I felt great.
No burning lungs, nothing.

I never felt like this after such an intense session.
And combined with the technical hands-on side of things to balance my very theoretical IT job, this was a perfect match.
Also, the meme culture is a great bonus, to be honest.

But I had no experience with bikes.
Unfortunately, the information about bike repair and fitting is very scattered and sometimes difficult to come by.
There is a lot of great video content on YouTube, but I find videos as reference material hard to use, as their content is not really searchable.
You often have to open multiple videos and skip in between them to find out if they cover exactly what you need.

Furthermore, a big part of the content is in English, but as I live in Germany and most bike shops only know the German names of the bike parts, I have to research and translate the technical terms every time.

So here I am writing/tracking everything down I have learned as a manual for myself and maybe others find it helpful as well.
