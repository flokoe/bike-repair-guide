When I first got my road bike, I could barely knew the difference between a derailleur and a cassette.
Everything just looked like a confusing collection of metal bits and cables that somehow made the bike go forward.

But here's the thing: understanding what each part does and where it belongs isn't just useful when something goes wrong â€“ it actually makes you a better cyclist.
Plus, it's pretty satisfying to finally know what your bike shop mechanic is talking about when they mention your "freehub" or ask about your "bottom bracket."

To get a better understanding, the diagram below shows the main components and component groups you'll find on a typical road bike.
It is a rough map to find the location of the major components.
If you can't find the exact component name you're looking for, just look at the general area on the diagram and click on the corresponding page in the list below, where we'll dive into the details with hands-on instructions.
